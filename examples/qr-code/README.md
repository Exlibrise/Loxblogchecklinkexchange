**qr-code** Docker image
========================

This Docker image contains an example API for the project "ln-paywall". For more info about the project visit https://github.com/philippgille/ln-paywall.

Prerequisites
-------------

- A running lnd node, either on a remote host and accessible from outside, or on the same host, in which case you can either start this container in "host network" mode, or use the container's gateway IP address to reach the host's localhost

Usage
-----

1. Create a data directory on the host: `mkdir data`
2. Copy the `tls.cert` and `invoice.macaroon` from your lnd to the `data` directory
3. Run the container: `docker run -d --name qr-code -v $(pwd)/data:/root/data -p 8080:8080 philippgille/qr-code -addr "123.123.123.123:10009"`
4. Send a request to generate an invoice: `curl http://localhost:8080/qr`
5. Pay the invoice that's in the response body via the Lightning Network
6. Send the request again, this time with the preimage as payment proof (hex encoded) and the data as query parameter: `curl -H "x-preimage: 119969c2338798cd56708126b5d6c0f6f5e75ed38da7a409b0081d94b4dacbf8" http://localhost:8080/qr?data=testtext`

The response contains the QR code as PNG image.

You can try out a deployed version on [https://lightning.ws](https://lightning.ws).
